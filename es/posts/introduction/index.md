# Why do I write this blog?

I write this blog primarily for two reasons:
Firstly, I find that Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is a subject well spread over the general population thanks to the multiple fictional works based on this. However, I also notice that there is a great misunderstanding on this subject. Although this misinformation may seem naive, I believe that it leads to people fearing illusions while being oblivious to real problems. The real danger of AI has more to do with our own devils than it has to do with the birth of a new intelligent (do not even consider conscious) being. I am aware that this topic has been already discussed multiple times and that people are starting to discern the real risks underneath A.I.. Nevertheless, I think that to understand the opportunities and hazards that A.I. offers, it is necessary to have some knowledge about the topic.
This is what brings me to my second reason: to try to make people grasp a little understanding of what is A.I. about. I would try to stick with the theoretical part, which may not sound interesting, but I think there is where the interest resides. My intention is to be formal while being readable, which might be a very ambitious task. I will try to overcome this challenge and, hopefully, to write a helpful and interesting blog.
